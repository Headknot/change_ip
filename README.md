## What is this?

change_ip is a tool for changing network adapter IP, Mask & Gateway in a Windows environment.
The need came out of the minor annoyance of clicking through "change adapter options" every time you need to change IP.
If you find yourself doing this a lot because of work f.ex, then this might save you a bit of time.

* QT/Pyside2 GUI
* Netsh commands
* Must be run as administrator!

## What does it look like?

See example screenshot below:
